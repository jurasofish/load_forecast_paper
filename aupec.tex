\section{Introduction}
The modern distribution network has changed more over the last ten years than it has in the previous hundred.
In the past, generation and load were largely separate; power was generated at large stations, and power was consumed by customers after traversing the transmission and distribution networks. 
These days, power is still consumed in the distribution network, but is also generated and manipulated by distributed energy resources (DER). 
\par
DERs are controllable devices in the power network that generate, store, and consume load. 
This includes solar generation (PV), battery storage, and electric vehicles (EV). 
\par
The Tasmanian distribution network is forecast to experience significant increases in these technologies by 2025: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item 600\% increase in battery storage capacity (from 100MWh to 600MWh) \cite{Jacobs2017}
	\item 170\% increase in PV installation capacity (from 130MW to 220MW) \cite{Jacobs2017}
	\item 39\% of new car sales with be EVs - the highest in the country \cite{AEMO2016}
\end{itemize}

This changing network presents an opportunity to maximize the use of existing assets by delaying the need for network augmentations, while also providing customers with a more reliable supply of power.
However, to achieve this requires sophisticated methods to optimize the power flow to and from the distributed resources \cite{Scott2014}.
\par
One requirement for optimization is an accurate forecast of day-ahead load at the feeder level.
Load forecasting methods commonly employed in industry are neither intended to forecast with high accuracy over a time period this short nor at such a low level in the distribution network \cite{CIGRE2016}.
As a result, the optimization of the distributed resources is not as effective as it could be.
\par
To solve this, a neural network-based load forecasting system is proposed.
This system will be applied to Bruny Island, in southern Tasmania, as a case study.
Bruny Island currently has a high penetration of PV and battery technology which is optimized by the Network-aware Coordination (NAC) algorithm \cite{Evan2016}.
Additionally, it is constrained by its feeder during peak holiday periods, necessitating an on-island diesel generator. The load forecasting system will need to be able to perform equally well on holidays, where the load is generally large, and on normal days. 
This makes it a perfect case study to highlight the potential benefits that distributed resources can have in the network.
This project and case study is supported by TasNetworks.


\section{Proposed Forecasting System}
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have recently been popular for load forecasting (cite blah).
Transformer models have achieved greater performance than RNNs in many language tasks (openAI).
(Transformer now justified for research).
This forecasting system uses a Transformer neural network model combined with similar day selection.
\par
This paper will present the transformer model, and then discuss its application in a case study.

\subsection{Transformer}
Use Attention is all You Need, and Attend and Diagnose as reference.
Sequence in, sequence out. Self attention.

\subsection{Similar Day}
Simple Euclidean distance between max/min temp, day of week, holiday type.

\section{Case Study}
The forecasting system was applied to Bruny Island.
Also discuss application to a common dataset for comparison with other papers?

\subsection{Data}
Discussion of available data and what was supplied to the forecasting system.

\subsection{Results}
Results of case study.

\section{Conclusion}
Blah Blah the forecaster works.
Maybe something about future work?
